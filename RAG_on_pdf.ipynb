Equipping the student nurse with the knowledge of anatomy and physiology will further assist the student in understanding what happens and what to do when the body is injured, diseased or placed under stress. This teaching and learning material (lecture note) for nursing students at a diploma level is prepared in line with this concept.  Therefore, the students are expected to achieve the following general educational objectives after completion of the course: - Understand and use anatomical terms. - Understand the function of the various organs and their relations with one another. - Know the location of each organ and the important anatomical land marks. - Know the normal structure of the human body in general. - Use the knowledge of anatomy and physiology in nursing practice.',\n",

       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 3  1.1 What are Anatomy and Physiology?  Anatomy: the word anatomy is derived from a Greek word âAnatomeâ meaning to cut up. It is the study of structures that make up the body and how those structures relate with each other.  The study of anatomy includes many sub specialties. These are Gross anatomy, Microscopic anatomy, Developmental anatomy and Embryology.  Gross anatomy studies body structure with out microscope. Systemic anatomy studies functional relationships of organs within a system whereas Regional anatomy studies body part regionally. Both systemic and regional approaches may be used to study gross anatomy   Microscopic anatomy (Histology) requires the use of microscope to study tissues that form the various organs of the body.  Physiology: the word physiology derived from a Greek word for study of nature. It is the study of how the body and its part work or function.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 4  Hence, Anatomy and physiology are studied together to give students a full appreciation and understanding of human body. Homeostasis When structure and function are coordinated the body achieves a relative stability of its internal environment called homeostasis / staying the same. Although the external environmental changes constantly, the internal environment of a healthy body remains the same with in normal limits.

Some of the functions controlled by homeostasis mechanisms are blood pressure, body temperature, breathing and heart rate.  1.2 Level of structural organization of the body  The human body has different structural levels of organization, starting with atoms molecules and compounds and increasing in size and complexity to cells, tissues, organs and the systems that make up the complete organism.',\n",

The system functions in protection, in the regulation of body temperature, in the excretion of waste materials, in the synthesis of vitamin D3 with the help of sunrays, and in the reception of various stimuli perceived as pain, pressure and temperature.  4.1 Skin  Skin is the largest organ in the body occupying almost 2m2 of surface area thickens of 2mm. Skin has 3 main parts. These are the epidermis, dermis and hypodermis.  Epidermis is the outer layer of the skin that is made of stratified squamous epithelium. It has no blood supply. Epidermis contains 4-5 strata. These are stratum cornium, lucidium, granulosum, spinosum and basale, Stratum cornium is the outer, dead, flat, Keratinized and thicker layer.',\n",

Eccrine glands are numerous over the palms and soles. Their secretary portion is embedded in the hypodermis. The sweat they secret is colorless, aqueous fluid containing neutral fats, albumin, urea, lactic acid and sodium chloride. Its excretion helps body temperature to be regulated.

Functions of muscle tissue Through sustained contraction or alternating contraction and relaxation, muscle tissue has three key functions: producing motion, providing stabilization, and generating heat.  1. Motion: Motion is obvious in movements such as walking and running, and in localized movements, such as grasping a pencil or nodding the head. These movements rely on the integrated functioning of bones, joints, and skeletal muscles.  2. Stabilizing body positions and regulating the volume of cavities in the body: Besides producing movements, skeletal muscle contractions maintain the body in stable positions, such as standing or sitting. Postural muscles display sustained contractions when a person is awake, for example, partially contracted neck muscles hold the head upright. In addition, the volumes of the body cavities are regulated through the contractions of skeletal muscles. For example muscles of respiration regulate the volume of the thoracic cavity during the process of breathing.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 110  Much of the heat released by muscle is used to maintain normal body temperature. Muscle contractions are thought to generate as much as 85% of all body heat.   Physiologic Characteristics of muscle tissue Muscle tissue has four principal characteristics that enable it to carry out its functions and thus contribute to homeostasis.  1. Excitability (irritability), a property of both muscle and nerve cells (neurons), is the ability to respond to certain stimuli by producing electrical signal called action potentials (impulses). For example, the stimuli that trigger action potentials are chemicals-neurotransmitters, released by neurons, hormones distributed by the blood. 2. Contractility is the ability of muscle tissue to shorten and thicken (contract), thus generating force to do work. Muscles contract in response to one or more muscle action potentials. 3.',\n",
       " 'Extensibility means that the muscle can be extended (stretched) without damaging the tissue. Most skeletal muscles are arranged in opposing pairs. While one is contracting, the other not only relaxed but also usually is being stretched. 4. Elasticity means that muscle tissue tends to return to its original shape after contraction or extension.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 111  Muscle structure  A. Connective Tissue Component  A skeletal muscle is an organ composed mainly of striated muscle cells and connective tissue. Each skeletal muscle has two parts; the connective tissue sheath that extend to form specialized structures that aid in attaching the muscle to bone and the fleshy part the belly or gaster. The extended specialized structure may take the form of a cord, called a tendon; alternatively, a broad sheet called an aponeurosis may attach muscles to bones or to other muscles, as in the abdomen or across the top of the skull. A connective tissue sheath called facia surrounds and separates muscles (Figure 6-1). Connective tissue also extends into the muscle and divides it into numerous muscle bundles (fascicles). There are three connective tissue components that cover a skeletal muscle tissue. These are: 1. Epimysiumâa connective tissue sheath that surrounds and separates muscle. 2. Perimysiumâa connective tissue that surrounds and holds fascicles together.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 112  B. Microscopic structures   The muscle bundles are composed of many elongated muscle cells called muscle fibres. Each muscle fibre is a cylindrical cell containing several nuclei located immediately beneath the cell membrane (sarcolemma). The cytoplasm of each muscle fibre (sarcoplasm) is filled with myofibrils. Each myofibril is a thread-like structure that extends from one end of the muscle fibre to the other. Myofibrils consist of two major kinds of protein fibres: actins or thin myofilaments, and myosin or thick myofilaments.  The actins and myosin myofilaments form highly ordered units called sarcomers, which are joined end-to-end to form the myofibrils (see Figure 6-1). Sarcomere is a structural and functional unit of muscle tissue. The ends of a sarcomere are a network of protein fibres, which form the Z-lines when the sarcomere is viewed from side. The Z-lines form an attachment site for actins myofilaments. The arrangement of the actin and myosin myofilaments in a sarcomere gives the myofibril a banded appearance because the myofibril appears darker where the actin and myosin myofilaments overlap.',\n",
       " 'The alternating light (I-band) and dark (A-band) areas of the sarcomers are responsible for striation (banding pattern) seen in skeletal muscle cells observed through the microscope.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 113  The sarcolemma of a muscle fibre forms blind-ended sacs or T-tubules which penetrate the cell and lie in the spaces between the myofibrils. The T-tubules contain interstitial fluid and do not open into the interior of the muscle fibre. Within the sarcoplasm of the muscle fibre there is an extensive network of branching and anastomosing channels, which forms the sarcoplasmic reticulum (this structure is a modified endoplasmic reticulum). The channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum lay in close contact around the ends of T-tubules, and contain stores of calcium.   Muscle contractions The thick myofilaments are composed of a protein called myosin. Each myosin filament has small regular projections known as crossbridges. The crossbridges lie in a radial fashion around the long axis of the myofilament. The rounded heads of the crossbridges lie in apposition to the thin myofilaments.  The thin myofilaments are composed of a complex protein called actin, arranged in a double stranded coil. The actin filaments also contain two additional proteins called troponin and tropomysin.',\n",

Structure of a skeletal muscle (From Memmler, Ruth Lundeen et al: The human body in Health and disease,ed.8, New York, 1996,Lippincott.)  In a resting muscle fibre the myosin crossbridges are prevented from combining with the actin filaments by the presence of troponin and tropomysin. When a nerve impulse reaches a muscle fibre it is conducted over the sarcolemma and in to the T-tubules, then to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium ions into the sacrcoplasm. The liberated calcium ions combine with troponin causing it to push tropomysin away from the receptor sites on the actins filaments. The myosin crossbridges interact',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 115  with the actin receptor sites and pull the actins myofilaments toward the centre (H-zone) of each sarcomere. The bond between the myosin crossbridges and actin breaks down under the influence of enzymes and the crossbridges are then free to rejoin with other actin receptor sites. The actin filaments do not shorten but slide past the myosin filaments overlapping them so that the Z lines are drawn toward each other, shortening the sarcomere. As each sarcomere shortens the whole muscle fibre contracts.  Relaxation of the muscle fibres occurs when the calcium ions are actively reabsorbed by the sarcoplasmic reticulum thus allowing troponin and tropomysin to again inhibit the interaction of the actins and myosin filaments (see Table 6-1 for summary of events in the contraction of a muscle fibre).  Energy Requirements for Muscle Contraction  Contraction o skeletal muscle requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The ATP releases energy when it breaks down to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a phosphate (P), some of the energy is used to move the crossbridges and some of the energy is released as heat.  ATPâADP + P + Energy (for crossbridge movement) + Heat',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 116  The ATP required for muscle contraction is produced primarily in numerous mitochondria located with in the muscle fibres. Because ATP is a very short-lived molecule and rapidly degenerates to the more stable ADP, it is necessary for muscle cells to constantly produce ATP.  ATP is produced by anaerobic or aerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration, which occurs in the absence of oxygen, results in the breakdown of glucose to yield ATP and lactic acid. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen and breaks down glucose to produce ATP, carbon dioxide, and water (figure 6-2). Compared with anaerobic respiration, aerobic respiration is much more efficient. The breakdown of glucose molecule by aerobic respiration theoretically can produce 19 times as much ATP as is produced by anaerobic respiration. In addition, aerobic respiration can utilize a greater variety of nutrient molecules to produce ATP than can anaerobic respiration. For example, aerobic respiration can use fatty acids to generate ATP. Although anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic respiration, it can produce ATP when lack of oxygen limits aerobic respiration.',\n",

Although some glucose is used as an energy source, fatty acids are a more important energy source during sustained exercise as well as during resting conditions. On the other hand, during intense exercise such as riding a bicycle up a steep hill, anaerobic respiration provides enough ATP to support intense muscle   Table 6-1. Summary of events in the contraction of a muscle fibre      Nerve impulse is transmitted via a motor nerve to the motor end plate Nerve impulse crosses neuromuscular junction by causing release of acetylcholine which depolarizes sarcolemma. Impulse is conducted into T-tubules and to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Calcium ions combine with troponin which pushes tropomycin away from action receptor sites. Myosin cross-bridges interact with actin receptor sites and thin myofilaments are drawn towards the centre of each sarcomere. Enzymic action breaks the bond between myosin crossbridges and actin receptor sites. Myosin crossbridges rejoin other actin receptor sites, each rejoining drawing the thin filaments closer to the centre of the sarcomere.',\n",
       " 'As each sarcomere shortens the whole muscle fibre contracts Calcium ion is reabsorbed by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Troponin and tropomysin again inhibit the interaction of myosin and actin myofilaments, and the muscle fibre relaxes.',\n",

Anaerobic and aerobic respiration       Contractions for approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Anaerobic respiration is ultimately limited by depletion of glucose and a build up of lactic acid within the muscle fibre. Lactic acid can also irritate muscle fibres, causing short-term muscle pain. Muscle pain that lasts for a couple of days following exercise, however, results from damage to connective tissue and muscle fibres within the muscle.  Muscle fatigue results when ATP is used during muscle contraction faster than it can be produced in the muscle cells, and lactic acid builds up faster than it can be removed. As a',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 119  consequence, ATP levels are too low to sustain crossbridge movement and the contractions become weaker and weaker. For most of us, however, complete muscle fatigue is rarely the reason we stop exercising. Instead, we stop because of psychological fatigue, the feeling that the muscles have tired. A burst of activity in a tired athlete as a result of encouragement from spectators is an example of how psychological fatigue can be overcome.  After intense exercise, the respiration rate remains elevated for a period. Even though oxygen is not needed for anaerobic production of ATP molecules for contraction, oxygen is needed to convert the lactic acid produced by anaerobic respiration back to glucose. The increased amount of oxygen needed in chemical reactions to convert lactic acid to glucose is the oxygen debt. After the oxygen debt is paid, respiration rate returns to normal.  Types of muscle contraction Muscle contractions are classified as either isotonic or isometric. In isotonic contractions, the amount of tension produced by the muscle is constant during contraction, but the length of the muscle changes; for example, movement of the fingers to make fist.',\n",

For example, when shaking hands, the muscles shorten some distance (isotonic contractions) and the degree of tension increases (isometric contractions).  Isometric contractions are also responsible for muscle tone, the constant tension produced by muscles of the body for long periods. Muscle tone is responsible for posture; for example, keeping the back and legs straight, the head held in upright position, and the abdomen from bulging.  Muscle attachments  Most muscles extend from one bone to another and cross at least one movable joint. Muscle contraction causes most body movements by pulling one of the bones towards the other across the movable joint. Some muscles are not attached to bone at both ends. For example, some facial muscles attach to the skin, which moves as the muscles contract.',\n",

The insertion of the triceps brachii is on the ulna and contraction results in extension of the forearm.  Several muscles contract while others relax to produce almost any movement you can imagine. Of all the muscles contracting simultaneously, the one mainly responsible for producing a particular movement is called the prime mover for that movement. The other muscles that help in producing the movement are called synergists. As prime movers and synergist muscles at a joint contract, other muscles called antagonists, relax.

The nervous system transmits information very rapidly by nerve impulses conducted from one body area to another. The endocrine system transmits information more slowly by chemicals secreted by ductless glands into blood steam and circulated from glands to other parts of the body. The nervous system serves as the chief coordinating agency. Conditions both within and outside the body are constantly changing; the purpose of the nervous system is to respond to these internal and external changes (known as stimuli) and so cause the body to adapt to new conditions. It is through the nerve impulse sent to the various organs by the nervous system that a person's internal harmony and the balance between the person and the environment are maintained. The nervous system has been compared to a telephone exchange, in that the brain and the spinal cord act as switching centres and the nerve trunks act as cables for carrying messages to and from these centres.  Cells of nervous system and their functions  The two types of cells found in the nervous system are called neurons or nerve cells and neuroglia, which are specialized connective tissue cells. Neurons conduct impulses, whereas neuroglia supports neurons.\",\n",

Identify each part on the neuron shown in figure 7-1. Dendrites are the processes or projections that transmit impulses to the neuron cell bodies, and axons are the processes that transmit impulses away from the neuron cell bodies.  Neurons can be classified structurally and functionally. The three types of functional classification of neurons are according to the direction in which they transmit impulses. These are: sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. Sensory neurons transmit impulses to the spinal cord and brain from all parts of the body. Motor neurons transmit impulses in the opposite direction-away from the brain and spinal cord. They do not conduct impulses to all parts of the body but only to two kinds of tissue-muscle and glandular epithelial tissue. Interneurons conduct impulses from sensory neurons to motor neurons.',\n",

In Figure 7-I, B, one such axon has been enlarged to show additional detail. Nodes of Ranvier are indentions between adjacent Schwann cells.  The outer cell membrane of a Schwann cell is called the neurilemma. The fact that axons in the brain and cord have no neurilemma is clinically significant because it plays an essential part in the regeneration of cut and injured axons. Therefore the potential for regeneration in the brain and spinal cord is far less than it is in the peripheral nervous system.',\n",

Impulse Generation and Conduction   The Nerve Impulse The cell membrane of an unstimulated (resting) neuron carries an electric charge. Because of positive and negative ions concentrated on either side of the membrane, the inside of the membrane at rest is negative as compared with the outside. A nerve impulse is a local reversal in the charge on the nerve cell membrane that then spreads along the membrane like an electric current. This sudden electrical change in the membrane is called an action potential. A stimulus, then, is any force that can start an action potential. This electric change results from rapid shifts in sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane.',\n",
       " 'The reversal occurs very rapidly (in less than one thousandth of a second) and is followed by a rapid return of the membrane to its original state so that it can be stimulated again.',\n",

The Synapse Each neuron is a separate unit, and there is no anatomic connection between neurons. How then is it possible for neurons to communicate?In other words, how does the axon of one neuron make functional contact with the membrane of another neuron?This is accomplished by the synapse, from a Greek word meaning \"to clasp.\"Synapses are points of junction for the transmission of nerve impulses (Fig 7-3).  Within the branching endings of the axon are small bubbles (vesicles) containing a type of chemical known as a neurotransmitter. When stimulated, the axon releases its neurotransmitter in to the narrow gap, the synaptic cleft, between the cells. The neurotransmitter then acts as a chemical signal to stimulate the next cell, described as the postsynaptic cell. On the receiving membrane, usually that of a dendrite, sometimes another part of the cell, there are special sites, or receptors, ready to pick up and respond to specific neurotransmitters.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 142  Although there are many known neurotransmitters, the main ones are epinephrine, also called adrenaline; a related compound, norepinephrine, or noradrenaline; and acetylcholine. Acetylcholine (Ach) is the neurotransmitter released at the neuromuscular junction, the synapse between a neuron and a muscle cell. All three of the above neurotransmitters function in the autonomic nervous system. It is common to think of neurotransmitters as stimulating the cells they reach; infact, they have been described as such in this discussion. Note, however, that some of these chemicals act to inhibit the postsynaptic cell and keep it from reacting.            Figure 7-2 Close-up view of a synapse.

A complete pathway through the nervous system from stimulus to response is termed a reflex arc (Fig.7-3). This is the basic functional pathway of the nervous system. The parts of a typical reflex arc are:  1. Receptor-the end of a dendrite or some specialized receptor cell, as in a special sense organ, that detects a stimuli. 2.

At its simplest, a reflex arc can involve just two neurons, one sensory and one motor, with a synapse in the CNS. There are very few reflex arcs that require only this minimal number of neurons.

Similarly, the usual designation for the nerves of the body is the peripheral nervous system or PNS. Use of the term peripheral is appropriate because nerves extend to outlying or peripheral parts of the body. A subdivision of the peripheral nervous system called the autonomic nervous system (ANS) consists of structures that regulate the body's autonomic or involuntary functions (for example, the heart rate, the contractions of the stomach, and intestines, and the secretion of chemical compounds by glands).  Central Nervous System  The CNS as its name implies, is centrally located. Its two major structures, the brain and spinal cord, are found along the midsagittal plane of the body.

The meninges are then surrounded by bone. The spinal meninges form tube like covering around the spinal cord and line the bony vertebral foramen of the vertebrae that surround the cord. Look at Figure 7-7, and you can identify the three layers of the spinal meninges. They are the dura mater, which is the tough outer layer that lines the vertebral canal, the pia mater, which is the innermost membrane covering the spinal cord itself, and the arachnoid, which is the membrane between the dura and pia mater. The term arachnoid means \"cobweblike.\"It comes from arachne, which is the Greek word for spider.

It lies just inside the cranial cavity superior to the large hole in the occipital bone called the foramen magnum. Like the spinal cord, the medulla consists of gray and white matter, but their arrangement differs in the two organs.

Thus the hypothalamus exerts a major control over virtually all-internal organs. Among the vital functions that it helps control are the heartbeat, constriction and dilation of blood vessels, and contractions of the stomach and intestines.  Some neurons in the hypothalamus function in a surprising way; they make the hormones that the posterior pituitary gland secretes into the blood. Because of one of these hormones (called antidiuretic hormone or ADH) affects the volume of urine excreted, the hypothalamus plays an essential role in maintaining the body's water balance.  Some of the neurons in the hypothalamus function as endocrine glands. Their axons secrete chemicals called releasing hormones into the blood, which then carries them to the anterior pituitary gland. Releasing hormones, as their name suggests, control the release of certain anterior pituitary hormones. These in turn influence the hormone secretion of other endocrine glands.\",\n",

Special sense organs, such as the eye, are characterized by large and complex organs or by localized groupings of specialized receptors in areas such as the nasal mucosa or tongue. The general sense organs for detecting stimuli such as pain and touch are microscopic receptors widely distributed through out the body. Other general sense organs include receptors that indicate the tension on our muscles and tendons so that we can maintain balance and muscle tone and be aware of the positions of our body parts. Table 7-3classifies the special sense organs.  Converting stimulus into a sensation All sense organs, regardless of size, type, or location, have in common some important functional characteristics. First, they must be able to sense or detect a stimulus in their environment. Of course, different sense organs detect and respond to different types of stimuli in different ways. Whether it is light, sound, temperature change, mechanical presence, or the presence of chemicals identified as taste or smell, the stimulus must be changed into an electrical signal or nerve impulse.

Three layers of tissue form the eye ball: the sclera, the choroids, and the retina (Figure 7-14). The outer layer of sclera consists of though fibrous tissue. The white of the eye is part of the front surface of the sclera. The other part of the front surface of the sclera is called the cornea and is sometimes spoken of as the window of the eye because of its transparency.

A mucous membrane known as the conjunctiva lines the eyelids and covers the sclera in front. The conjunctiva is kept moist by tears formed in the lacrimal gland located in the upper lateral portion of the orbit.  The middle layer of the eyeball, the choroid, contains a dark pigment to prevent the scattering of incoming light rays. Two involuntary muscles make up the front part of the choroids. One is the iris, the colored structure seen through the cornea, and the othere is the ciliary muscle (Figure 7-14). The black center of the iris is really a hole in this doughnut-shaped muscle; it is pupil of the eye. Some of the fibers of the iris are arranged like spokes in a wheel. When they contract the pupils dilate, letting in more light rays. Other fibers are circular.',\n",

Most of us become more farsighted as we grow older and lose the ability to focus on close objects because our lenses lose their elasticity and con no longer bulge enough to bring near objects into focus. Presbyopia or oldsightedness is the name for this condition.  The retina or innermost layer of the eyeball contains microscopic receptor cells, called rods and cones because of their shapes. Dim light can stimulate the rods, but fairly bright',\n",

There are three kinds of cones; each is sensitive to a different colour: red, green, or blue. Scattered throughout the central portion of the retina, these three types of cones allow us to distinguish between different colours.  Fluids fill the hollow inside of the eyeball. They maintain the normal shape of the eyeball and help refract light rays; that is, the fluids bend light rays to bring them to focus on the retina. Aqueous humor is the name of the watery fluid in front of the lens (in the anterior cavity of the eye), and vitreous humor is the name of the jellylike fluid behind the lens (in the posterior cavity). Aqueous humor is constantly being formed, drained, and replaced in the anterior cavity.

Refraction occurs as light passes through the cornea, the aqueous humor, the lens, and the vitreous humor on its way to the retina.

The auricle is the appendage on the side of the head surrounding the opening of the external auditory canal. The canal itself is a curve about 2.5 cm (1 inch) in length. It extends into the temporal bone and ends at the tympanic membrane or eardrum, which is a partition between the external and middle ear. The skin of the auditory canal, especially in its outer one third, contains many short hairs and ceruminous glands that produce a waxy substance called cerumen that may collect in the canal and impair hearing by absorbing or blocking the passage of sound waves. Sound waves travelling through the external auditory canal strike the tympanic membrane and cause it to vibrate.  Middle Ear The middle ear is a tiny and very thin epithelium lined cavity hollowed out of the temporal bone. It houses three very small bones. The names of these ear bones, called ossicles, describe their shapes â malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup). The \"handle\" of the malleus attaches to the inside of the tympanic membrane, and the \"head\" attaches to the incus.',\n",

Movement of the stapes against the oval window causes movement of fluid in the inner ear. A point worth mentioning, because it explains the frequent spread of infection from the throat to the ear, is the fact that a tubeâ the auditory or eustachian tubeâ connects the throat with the middle ear. The epithelial lining of the middle ears, auditory tubes, and throat are extensions of one continuous membrane. Consequently a sore throat may spread to produce a middle ear infection called otitis media.  Inner Ear The activation of specialized mechanoreceptors in the inner ear generates nervous impulses that result in hearing and equilibrium. Anatomically, the inner ear consists of three spaces in the temporal bone, assembled in a complex maze called the bony labrynth. This odd shaped bony space is filled with a watery fluid called perilymph and is divided into the following parts: vestibule, semicircular canals, and cochlea. The vestibule is adjacent to the oval window between the semicircular canals and the cochlea (Figure 7-16).

Eventually, nervous impulses passing through this nerve reach the cerebellum and medulla. Other connections from these areas result in impulses reaching the cerebral cortex.  The organ of hearing, which lies in the snail shaped cochlea, is the organ of Corti. It is surrounded by endolymph filling the membranous cochlea or cochlear duct, which is the membranous tube within the bony cochlea. Specialized hair cells on the organ of Corti generate nerve impulses when they are bent by the movement or endolymph set in motion by sound waves (Figures 7-16 and 7-17).  The Taste Receptors   The chemical receptors that generate nervous impulses resulting in the sense of taste are called taste buds. About 10,000 of these microscopic receptors are found on the sides of much larger structure on the tongue called papillae and also as portions of other tissues in the mouth and throat. Nervous impulses are generated by specialized cells in taste buds, called gustatory cells.

The Smell Receptors The chemical receptors responsible for the sense of smell are located in a small area of epithelial tissue in the upper part o the nasal cavity (Figure 7-19). The location of the olfactory receptors is somewhat hidden, and we are often forced to forcefully sniff air to smell delicate odors. Each olfactory cell has a number of specialized cilia that sense different chemicals and cause the cell to respond by generating a nervous impulse. To be detected by olfactory receptors, chemicals must be dissolved in the watery mucus that lines the nasal cavity.',\n",

Progressive reduction of the sense of smells often seen in smokers because of the damaging effects the pollutants in tobacco smoke.

GH accelerates overall body growth by increasing the mass of both skeletal and soft body tissues through hyperplasia (increased cell number) and hypertrophy (increased cell size).  The effects of GH are particularly evident in skeletal tissues where chondrogenesis (cartilage formation) and osteogenesis (bone formation) are enhanced, leading to an increase in linear growth and stature before epiphyseal closure and increased bone thickness following closure of the epiphyses.  Growth hormone stimulates certain tissues, notably the liver, to produce somatomedins or insulinlike growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II).

In muscle and liver, the protein anabolic effects are attributed directly to GH. However, in cartilage, bone, and other body tissues, the protein anabolic and growth-promoting actions are mediated by insulinlike growth factors (somatomedins).  Lipid metabolism: GH stimulates the mobilization and utilization of fats by promoting lipolysis in adipose tissue, thus enabling the body to use stored fats as an energy source. The elevation of plasma levels of free fatty acids resulting from the hydrolysis of triglycerides (stored neutral fats) is potentially ketogenic.  Carbohydrate metabolism: GH elevates blood glucose levels by increasing the hepatic output of glucose (gluconeogenesis) and impairing glucose transport into muscle and adipose tissue (\"anti-insulin\" action). Excessive secretion of GH may precipitate or increase the severity of clinical diabetes mellitus (\"diabetogenic\" effect).',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 215  2. Prolactin (PRL)  Control of Secretion Prolactin (PRL) is a peptide hormone composed of 199 amino acids. Its secretion by the lactotrophs of the adenohypoiphysis is tonically suppressed by dopamine (also known as PIH) of hypothalamic origin. Dopamine antagonists (eg, antipsychotic drugs) promote PRL secretion by blocking dopamine receptors, whereas dopamine agonists (eg, bromocriptine) inhibit PRL secretion by activating dopamine receptors.  Secretion of PRL increases during pregnancy, peaking near the time of parturition. Sucking and tactile stimulation of the nipple increase PRL secretion.  Prolactin facilitates the secretion of dopamine in the hypothalamus, thereby regulating its own secretion by a negative feedback mechanism.  Actions Prolactin initiates and maintains milk secretion from breasts primed for lactation by other hormones such as estrogens, progesterone, and insulin. It also appears to inhibit the effects of the gonadotropins and may prevent ovulation in lactating women. Excessive production of PRL (hyperprolactinemia), which may accompany some pituitary tumors, may cause an',\n",

Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)  Control of Secretion Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a glycoprotein gonadotropic hormone whose secretion is stimulated by hypothalamic GnRH. Inhibit, a polypeptide produced by testicular sertoli cells in the male and follicular granulosa cells in the female, acts directly on the adenohypophysis to inhibit FSH secretion.  Actions Follicle-stimulating hormone directly stimulates the sertoli cells in testicular seminiferous tubles, there by promoting spermatogenesis in the male. In the female, FSH stimulates follicular growth and development within the ovaries. The actions of FSH are mediated by cyclic AMP.  4. Luteinizing Hormone (LH; Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone; ICSH)  Control of Secretion Like FSH, LH is a glycoprotein hormone whose secretion is stimulated by GnRH. Testosterone inhibits LH secretion',\n",

The effects of female hormones on LH secretion are more complex. Constant, moderate levels of estrogen (without progesterone) have a negative feedback effect on LH, whereas high estrogen levels exert a positive feedback that leads to a surge in LH production. High levels of progesterone and estrogen (luteal phase of the ovulatory cycle) inhibit LH secretion.  Actions In the male, this hormone stimulates testosterone production by testicular interstitial cells (of Leydig); hence the alternate name, interstitial cell stimulating hormone (ICSH).  In the female, LH promotes maturation of ovarian follicles and sustains their secretion of estrogens. LH is also responsible for ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum. The actions of LH are mediated by cyclic AMP.  5.

The actions of TSH on the thyroid gland are mediated by cyclic AMP, and they are detailed in the section on the thyroid gland.  6. Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (Corticotropin; ACTH)  Control of Secretion Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is secreted in irregular bursts that follow a diurnal circadian rhythm, with peak production in the early morning. ACTH secretion is regulated by the hypophyseotropic hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) the increased production of ACTH in response to many stressors appears to be mediated through the hypothalamus and CRH. Elevated plasma free glucocorticoid (cortisol) levels inhibit both CRH and ACTH secretion.',\n",

The stimulation of corticosteroid production (Steroidogenesis) in response to ACTH is mediated by the second messenger, cyclic AMP.  Hormones of the Neurohypophysis  1. Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH; Vasopressin)  Control of Secretion Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a polypeptide hormone of hypothalamic origin that is stored in and released from the neurohypophysis in response to a variety of stimuli. Included among these are increased plasma osmolality, reduced extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, pain, emotional stress, and such pharmacologic agents as morphine, nicotine, barbiturates, and certain general anesthetics.  Decreased plasma osmolality, increased ECF volume, and alcohol inhibit ADH secretion. Osmoreceptors found in the anterior hypothalamus monitor changes in plasma osmolality, whereas ECF volume changes are detected by volume (\"Stretch\") receptors located in the wall the left atrium. The osmoreceptors and volume receptors work in concert to exert',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 220  precise control over ADH secretion, thus forming a delicate homeostatic feedback mechanism for the regulation of ECF volume and concentration.  Actions The principal physiologic role of ADH is to regulate extracellular fluid volume and osmolality by controlling the final volume and concentration of urine. ADH increases the permeability of the distal nephron (late distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts) to water. The enhanced reabsorption of water from the renal tubules results in the production a concentrated urine that is reduced in volume. Pharmacologic amounts of ADH produce a pressor (hypertensive) effect that results from a direct constrictor action of the hormone on vascular smooth muscle. The early observations that posterior pitutary extracts produce a marked elevation of arterial blood pressure led to the initial naming of this hormone as vasopressin.  2. Oxytocin  Control of Secretion and Actions The two major physiologic actions of oxytocin are exerted on the female breast and uterus. Oxytocin binds to a G-protein coupled receptor that ultimately brings about elevated intracellular calcium levels.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 221  Galactokinetic Action (Milk Ejection Reflex). The ejection of milk from a primed, lactating mammary gland follows a neuroendocrine reflex in which oxytocin serves as the efferent limb. The reflex is normally initiated by sucking, which stimulates cutaneous receptors in the areola of the breast. Afferent nerve impulses travel to the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus to effect the release of oxytocin from the neurohypophysis. Oxytocin is carried by the blood to the mammary gland, where it causes contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli and lactiferous ducts to bring about the ejection of milk (milk letdown). In lactating women, tactile stimulation of the breast areola, emotional stimuli, and genital stimulation may also lead to oxytocin release and activate the ejection of milk.  Oxytocic Action. Oxytocin acts directly on uterine smooth muscle to elicit strong, rhythmic contractions of the myometrium. Uterine sensitivity to oxytocin varies with its physiologic state and with hormonal balance. The gravid (Pregnant) uterus is highly sensitive to oxytocin, particularly in the late stages of gestation.',\n",

The Thyroid Gland The hormones of the thyroid gland exert a wide spectrum of metabolic and physiologic actions that affect virtually every tissue in the body.  Anatomy The thyroid gland is a bilobed organ overlying the trachea anteriorly. The thyroid gland is composed of numerous closely packed spheres or follicles. Each follicle consists of a simple cuboidal epithelium (follicular cells) enclosing a lumen or cavity containing a viscous hyaline substance termed colloid. The chief constituent of the colloid is the iodinated glycoprotein thyroglobulin. Interspersed among the follicles are small clusters of parafollicular (C) cells, which secrete calcitonin, a hormone affecting calcium metabolism.  Thyroid Hormones The follicular cells of the thyroid gland secrete two hormones, thyroxine (3, 3', 5, 5'-tetraiodothyronine or T4) and 3, 3', 5- triiodothyronine (T3). The plasma levels of these hormones are regulated by the hypothalamopituitary axis as outlined in Figure 8-2. Intrinsic (intrathyroidal) mechanisms, as well as bioavailability of iodine, influence thyroid hormone production.\",\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 223  Biosynthesis of Thyroid Hormones 1. Iodide uptake: Ingested iodine is readily absorbed from the GI tract in the reduced iodide state. Iodide ions are actively transported from the blood into the thyroid follicles by an energy-requiring \"trapping\" mechanism often called the iodide pump. The normal thyroid: serum ratio of iodide is 25:1. The uptake of iodide is enhanced by TSH and may be blocked by anions such as perchlorate and thiocyanate. 2. Oxidation to iodine: On entering the colloid, iodide is rapidly oxidized to iodine in the presence of peroxidase enzymes. Thiouracil appears to inhibit peroxidase activity. 3. Iodination of tyrosine: Free molecular iodine spontaneously combines with tyrosine residues on the thyroglobulin (TGB) to form 3-monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and 3, 5-diiodotyrosine (DIT).',\n",
       " 'This organic iodination is enhanced by TSH and blocked by agents such as propylthiouracil and methimazole. Goitrogens found in cabbage, kale, and turnips, as well as cobalt and phenylbutazone, also block organification of iodine. 4. Coupling reaction: Two iodinated tyrosines combine to form either T3 or T4. The coupling occurs within the thyroglobulin molecule, and the reaction appears to be promoted by TSH. 5. Storage and release of thyroid hormones: T3 and T4 remain stored within the colloid bound to thyroglobulin',\n",

On stimulation by TSH,portions of the TGB(colloid) are engulfed by microvilli that extend from the apical surface of the follicular cells. Droplets of the engulfed colloid fuse with lysosomes, and proteolytic enzymes release T3 and T4 from the TGB. The lipophilic hormones (T3 and T4) readily diffuse to nearby capillaries and enter the bloodstream.  Thyroid-stimulating hormone, acting through cyclic AMP, increases the production of thyroid hormones by promoting virtually every step in the biosynthetic process, including the synthesis of TGB and the eventual release of T3 and T4 from storage.  Transport Circulating thyroid hormones bind specifically with thyroxine- binding globulin and thyroxine-binding prealbumin, and non- specifically with serum albumin. The extent of plasma protein binding can be measured as protein-bound iodine (PBI).  Only the small fraction of circulating thyroid hormones that is in the free (unbound) form is physiologically active and inhibitory to TSH secretion.

High levels of estrogen, such as those occurring in pregnancy or during oral contraceptive therapy, elevate plasma protein levels, thereby increasing PBI levels.  Fate Thyroid hormones are inactivated by deiodination, deamination, decarboxylation, or conjugation with glucuronic acid or sulfate. Much of the iodine released during biodegradation is recycled and reused for synthesis of new hormones. The remainder is excreted in the urine. Metabolism occurs chiefly in the liver, and excretion is mainly through the kidneys. The conjugated hormones are excreted through the bile and eliminated in the stool.  Actions The thyroid hormones increase the rate of metabolism, total heat production, and oxygen consumption in most body tissues. Exceptions include the adult brain, spleen, lymph nodes, uterus, and testes. The thyroid hormones promote normal physical growth and development, and they are essential for normal myelination and development of the nervous system in early life.',\n",

The metabolic actions of the thyroid hormones are some what complex, being dependent on the level of the thyroid hormones, as well as on the presence of other hormones, for example, catecholamines and insulin. In normal physiologic amounts, the thyroid hormones stimulate protein synthesis, increase lipid turnover, lower plasma cholesterol, and promote GI absorption of glucose. T3 is more potent and more rapidly active than T4; in fact, the latter may be considered a prohormone, since most target cells convert T4 into T3.  The Parathyroid Glands The parathyroid glands, usually four in number, are embedded in the dorsal surface of the thyroid gland. In response to hypocalcemia (low plasma calcium), the chief cells of the parathyroid glands secrete a single 84- amino-acid polypeptide hormone known as parathyroid hormone (PTH).  Parathyroid hormone regulates serum calcium levels by exerting its effects on the following target tissues: - Bone: PTH stimulates bone resorption by activating the bone-destroying osteoclasts. The demineralization of bone elevates plasma calcium and phosphate levels;',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 227  however, the renal actions of PTH lead to a net decrease in plasma phosphate levels. - Kidneys: PTH promotes renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and increases urinary excretion of phosphate by blocking its reabsorption. PTH also stimulates the activity of a renal enzyme that catalyzes the formation of calcitriol, an active metabolite of vitamin D (see chapter 75). Calcitriol elevates plasma calcium and phosphate levels primarily by promoting the intestinal absorption of both ions, but also by increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate.  The major actions of PTH are mediated by cyclic AMP.  The Pancreas The endocrine functions of the pancreas are performed by the islets of langerhans (also called pancreatic islets) âsmall, highly vascularized masses of cells scattered throughout the pancreas and representing only 1% to 3% of the entire organ.  The Islets of Langerhans contain four types of secretary cells, as follows: â¢ Alpha (A) cells, which secrete glucagons â¢ Beta (B) cells, which secrete insulin â¢ Delta (D) cells, which secrete somatostatin â¢ PP (F) cells, which secrete pancreatic polypeptide',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 228  Insulin-secreting beta cells are the most numerous, making up to 75% of the islet cell population. The A cells containing glucagons comprise approximately 20% of islet cell mass, whereas the somatostatinâcontaining D cells accou8nt for 3% to 5% of pancreatic islet cells. The F cells make up less than 2% of islet cells and secrete a polypeptide that slows food absorption in humans, but whose exact physiologic significance is unclear.  The paracrine relationship exists within the pancreatic islets, with one hormone affecting the secretion of other pancreatic hormones. Somatostatin inhibits the secretion of insulin, glucagons, and pancreatic polypeptide. Insulin inhibits the secretion of glucagons, whereas glucagon stimulates the secretion of insulin and somatostatin.  1. Glucagon Glucagon is a 29-amino-acid polypeptide hormone secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets primarily in response to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Glucagon is essentially a catabolic hormone that decreases carbohydrate and lipid energy stores and increases the amount of glucose and fatty acids available for oxidation.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 229  Control of Secretion The plasma glucose concentration is the major physiologic regulator of glucagons secretion. In addition to hypoglycemia and fasting, the following factors promote glucagons secretion: amino acids, exercise, stress, gastrin, cortisol, CCK, acetylcholine, and beta-adrenergic stimulation. The rate of glucagons secretion is inhibited by elevated blood levels of glucose and free fatty acids, and by somatostatin, insulin, secretin, phenytoin, and alpha-adrenergic stimulation.  Major Actions - Carbohydrate metabolism: Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis, thereby promoting the release of glucose from liver glycogen stores. The action is mediated by cyclic AMP, which stimulates protein kinase activity, leading to the activation of phosphorylase, the glycogenolytic enzyme. Glucagon also interacts with hormone receptors coupled to the activation of phospholipase C, which eventually leads to calcium influx and stimulation of glycogenolysis. In addition to stimulating hepatic glycogenolysis, glucagon inhibits glycogenesis and raises the rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis. The net effect is an elevation of blood glucose ( hyperglycemia). - Lipid metabolism: Glucagon stimulates lipolysis, thereby increasing the release of free fatty acids and glycerol from',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 230  adipose tissue. Glucagon also enhances hepatic ketogenesis by facilitating conversion of fatty acids to ketone bodies. - Protein metabolism: Glucagon exerts a catabolic action on hepatic proteins and inhibits the incorporation of amino acids into hepatic protein. - Cardiac effects: large amounts of exogenous glucagons produce appositive inotropic effect on the heart by increasing myocardial levels of cyclic AMP.  2. Insulin  Structure, Biosynthesis, and Secretion Insulin is a polypeptide hormone composed of 51 amino acids arranged in two chains (A and B), linked by disulfide bridges. Insulin is derived from a large polypeptide precursor-proinsulin which is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum of beta cells and packaged into membrane-bounded granules within the Golgi complex.  Insulin secretion occurs through exocytosis (emiocytosis), a calcium-dependent process that is enhanced by cyclic AMP and potassium. On entering the circulation, insulin is transported largely in free molecular form, not bound to plasma proteins.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 231  Control of Secretion The secretion of insulin is regulated primarily by the blood glucose level, with an elevation of blood glucose (hyperglycemia), increasing both production and release of insulin. Ingested glucose effects a far greater secretion of insulin than an equivalent amount of intravenously administered glucose because several gastrointestinal hormones, including gastrin, secretin, CCK, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), and glucagons, stimulate insulin secretion. Insulin secretion is also increased by mannose, certain amino acids, vagal stimulation (acetylcholine), cyclic AMP, betaadrenergic stimulation, potassium, and oral hypoglycemic drugs such as tolbutamide. Hyperglycemia, somatostatin, alpha-adrenergic stimulation, thiazide diuretics, phenytoin, and diazoxide inhibit insulin secretion.  Major Actions â¢ Cellular membrane permeability: Insulin facilitates the transport of glucose across selected cell membranes, thereby accelerating the entry of glucose into muscle, adipose tissue, fibroblasts, leukocytes, mammary glands, and the anterior pituitary. The transport of glucose into the liver, brain, renal tubules, intestinal mucosa, and erythrocytes is independent of insulin. Exercise and hypoxia mimic the effect of insulin on cellular permeability to glucose in skeletal muscle. The insulin requirements of',\n",

Insulin also increases cellular permeability to amino acids, fatty acids, and potassium, particularly in muscle and adipose tissue. â¢ Carbohydrate metabolism: Insulin effectively lowers the level of blood glucose by enhancing the transport and peripheral utilization of glucose. Insulin increases muscle and liver glycogen while inhibiting those that produce glycogenolysis. Glycolytic enzymes are also activated by insulin, whereas several enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis are inhibited. â¢ Protein metabolism: Insulin is strongly anabolic, increasing protein synthesis and inhibiting protein catabolism. Insulin increases the incorporation of amino acids into protein by accelerating the entry of amino acids into the cell and possibly by increasing RNA synthesis. â¢ Lipid metabolism: Insulin stimulates formation of triglycerides (lipogenesis) and inhibits their breakdown (lipolysis). Insulin accelerates synthesis of fatty acid and glycerol phosphate and enhances cellular permeability to fatty acids, leading to increased deposition of triglycerides in adipose tissue.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 233  3. Pancreatic Somatostatin Unlike glucagons and insulin, pancreatic somatostatin does not directly regulate intermediary metabolism. Rather, it slows digestion and absorption of nutrients by exerting several inhibitory effects on digestive processes (eg, reduced gastric acid secretion decreased gastric emptying and inhibition of CCK secretion and gallbladder contraction).  Pancreatic somatostatin secretion is stimulated by elevations and gastrointestinal hormones (eg, CCK). The paracrine actions of somatostatin in the pancreatic islets have been discussed previously.  The Adrenal Glands The adrenal (suprarenal) glands are paired yellowish masses of tissue situated at the superior pole of each kidney. Each gland consists of two distinct entitiesâan outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medullaâthat differ in embryologic origin, character, and function.  Adrenal Medulla The adrenal medulla develops from the embryonic ectoderm. It remains functionally associated with the sympathetic nervous system, being essentially a modified sympathetic ganglion whose postganglionic neurons have lost their axons and become secretory.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 234  Histologically, the adrenal medulla contains large, ovoid cells arranged in clumps or irregular cords around numerous blood vessels. The medullary cells, often termed chromaffin cells because their granules possess affinity for chromium salts, secrete the catecholamine hormones epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenalin). The principal secretory product is epinephrine, with norepinephrine normally accounting for only 20% of the total secretion.  Adrenal medullary secretion of the catecholamines is physiologically controlled by the posterior hypothalamus. The hormones are stored in cellular granules, bound to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and protein, and are released in response to the following stimuli: sympathetic nervous system activation, hypoglycemia, pain, hypoxia, hypotension, cold, emotional stress, acetylcholine, histamine, and nicotine.  Actions of Adrenal Modullary Hormones Epinephrine and norepinephrine mimic the effects of sympathetic nerve discharge, producing the following effects: â¢ Direct increase in cardiac rate and myocardial force of contraction â¢ Dilation of coronary and skeletal muscle blood vessels â¢ Constriction of the cutaneous and visceral vasculature â¢ Relaxation of respiratory smooth muscle â¢ Inhibition of GI motility',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 235  â¢ Pupillary dilation (mydriasis) â¢ Glycogenolysis in liver and muscle â¢ Lipolysis  The cardiac excitatory effects and the metabolic actions of lipolysis and glycogenolysis are mediated by cyclic AMP, the latter involving the activation of phosphorylase enzyme by protein kinase.  The catecholamines also elevate the metabolic rate (calorigenic action), stimulate the central nervous system, increase alertness, and stimulate respiration.  Adrenal Cortex  The adrenal cortex develops from the mesoderm during embryonic life. The cells of the adrenal cortex, which are arranged in continuous cords separated by capillaries, are characterized by an abundance of mitochondria, endoplamic reticulum, and accumulation of lipid.  Adrenal cortical tissue is structurally arranged into three concentric regions or zones: a thin outer zona glomerulosa, a thick middle zona fasciculate, and an inner zona reticularis bordering on the adrenal medulla.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 236  Chemically, the steroid hormones of the adrenal cortex, the adrenocorticoids, are all derivatives of cholesterol. The adrenocorticoid hormones are usually divided into three functional groups: the mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, which regulate electrolyte and water balance; the glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, which affect carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism; and the adrenogenital steroids or sex hormones.  The adrenogenital steroids are of three types: androgens (such as dehydroepiandrosterone), estrogens (such as estradiol), and progestins (such as progesterone).  Under normal physiologic conditions the adrenogenital steroids are secreted (under ACTH control) in minute amounts, and therefore they exert minimal effects on reproductive functions. Excessive secretion of adrenal androgens results in precocious pseudopuberty in boys, and causes masculinization of females (adrenogenital syndrome).  1.

Its secretion is regulated primarily by the reninangiotensin mechanism. The plasma',\n",

Hyperkalemia (elevated plasma potassium) exerts a direct stimulating effect on the zona glomerulosa, whereas hyponatremia (low plasma sodium) activates the rennin-angiotensin mechanism. Atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) inhibits rennin secretion, and it also reduces the responsiveness of the cells in the zona glomerulosa to angiotensin II. Other factors contributing to the control of aldosterone secretion include blood volume and ACTH, the latter exerting a limited, nonselective stimulatory effect.  Aldosterone plays a major physiologic role in the maintenance of electrolyte and fluid balance by promoting the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium and the secretion of potassium and hydrogen. Aldosterone binds to nuclear receptors and stimulates DNA-directed RNA synthesis leading to increased formation of specific proteins involved in sodium and potassium transport.  A similar sodium-retaining, potassium-excreting action is exerted on other target tissues, including salivary glands and sweat glands.

       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 238  2. Gllucocorticoids  Control of Secretion and Actions. Glucocorticoid secretion, which occurs primarily in the zona fasciculate, is controlled by ACTH. A variety of stressful stimuli, including anxiety, fear, hypoglycaemia, hypotension, and haemorrhage, increase secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus. CRH promotes ACTH secretion by the adenohypophysis, and ACTH stimulates adrenal cortical secretory activity, thereby elevating blood levels of cortisol (the principal physiologic glucocorticoid). Elevated blood levels of free cortisol normally exert a negative feedback control over further secretion of CRH and ACTH. Prolonged ACTH secretion results in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and excessive secretion of all adrenocorticoid hormones.

Other permissive effects include support for the metabolic actions (particularly lipolysis) of the catecholamines and glucagons. â¢ Blood and immunologic effects: Glucocorticoids inhibit the immune response, cause involution of lymphoid tissue, and reduce blood levels of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. These hormones also stimulate erythropoiesis and elevate circulating levels of platelets and neutrophils. â¢ GI tract effects: Glucocorticoid hormones stimulate gastric acid and pepsin secretion and inhibit the production of protective mucus, thereby favouring development of gastric ulcers.

Those structures directly concerned with reproduction are considered primary sex characteristics. Testosterone is also responsible for male secondary sex characteristics such as a deep voice and facial hair.  In the female, the hormones that most nearly parallel testosterone in their actions are the estrogens. Estrogens contribute to the development of the female secondary sex characteristics and stimulate the development of the mammary glands, the onset of menstruation, and the development and functioning of the reproductive organs.

Composition of Blood The blood is composed of two prime elements: as already mentioned, the liquid element is called plasma; the cells and fragments of cells are called formed elements or corpuscles (Figure 9-1). The formed elements are classified as follows: 1. Erythrocytes, from erythro, meaning âred,â are the red blood cells, which transport oxygen. 2.

Blood Plasma Over half of the total volume of blood is plasma. The plasma itself is 90% water. Many different substances dissolved or suspended in the water, make up the other 10%. The plasma content varies somewhat, since the substances carried by the blood to and from the organs get used and added to. However, the body tends to maintain a fairly constant level of these substances. For example, the level of glucose, a simple sugar,',\n",

After water, the next largest percentage of material in the plasma is protein. Proteins are the principal constituents of cytoplasm and are essential to the growth and the rebuilding of body tissues. The plasma proteins include the following: 1. Albumin, the most abundant protein in plasma, is important for maintaining the osmotic pressure of the blood. This protein is manufactured in the liver. 2. The antibodies combat infection. 3. The blood clotting factors are also manufactured in the liver.',\n",

One group of nutrients is the carbohydrates. The principal form of carbohydrate found in the plasma is glucose, which is absorbed by the capillaries of the intestine following digestion. Glucose is stored mainly in the liver as glycogen and released as needed to supply energy. Amino acids, the products of protein digestion, are also found in the plasma. These are also absorbed into the blood through the intestinal capillaries. Lipids constitute a small percentage of blood plasma. Lipids include fats.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 250  mineral salts in the plasma appear primarily as chloride, carbonate, or phosphate salts of sodium, potassium, and magnesium. These salts have a variety of functions, including the formation of bone (calcium and phosphorus), the production of hormones by certain glands (iodine for the production of thyroid hormone), the transportation of the gases oxygen and carbon dioxide (iron), and the maintenance of the acid base balance (sodium and potassium carbonates and phosphates). Small amounts of other elements also help maintain homeostasis. Many other materials, such as waste products and hormones, are also transported in the plasma.  The Formed Elements  Erythrocytes Erythrocytes, the red cells, are tiny, disk-shaped bodies with a central area that is thinner than the edges. They are different from other cells in that the mature form found in the circulating blood does not have a nucleus. These cells, like almost all the blood cells, live a much shorter time (120 days) than most other cells in the body, some of which last a lifetime. One purpose of the red cells is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. The oxygen is bound in the red cells to haemoglobin, a protein that contains iron. Haemoglobin combined with oxygen gives the blood its characteristic red color.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 251  Therefore, the blood that goes from the lungs to the tissues is a bright red because it carries a great supply of oxygen; in contrast, the blood that returns to the lings is a much darker red, since it has given up much of its oxygen to the tissues. Haemoglobin that has given up its oxygen is able to carry hydrogen ions; in this way, haemoglobin acts as a buffer and plays an important role in acid-base balance. The red cells also carry a small amount of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lings for elimination in exhalation.  Carbon monoxide is a harmful gas that combines with haemoglobin to form a stable compound. It displaces the oxygen that is normally carried by the haemoglobin and reduces the oxygen-carrying ability of the blood. Carbon monoxide may be produced by the incomplete burning of various fuels, such as gasoline, coal, wood, and other carbon containing materials. It also occurs in automobile exhaust fumes and in cigarette smoke.  The erythrocytes are by far the most numerous of the corpuscles, averaging from 4.5 to 5 million per cubic millimetre of blood.  Leukocytes  The leukocytes, or white blood cells, are very different from the erythrocytes in appearance, quantity, and function. They contain',\n",

Leukocytes are outnumbered by red cells by 700 to 1, numbering 5,000 to 10,000 per cubic millimetre of blood. Whereas the red cells have a definite color, the leukocytes tend to be colorless.  The different types of white blood cells are identified by their size, the shape of the nucleus, and the appearance of granules in the cytoplasm when the cells are stained, usually with Wrightâs blood stain. Granulocytes include neutrophils, which show lavender granules; eosinophils, which have beadlike, bright pink granules; and basophils, which have large, dark blue granules that often obscure the nucleus. The neutrophils are the most numerous of the white cells, constituting up to 60% of all leukocytes.  Because the nuclei of the nuclei of the neutrophils are of various shapes, they are also called polymorphs (meaning âmany formsâ) or simply polys.  The agranulocytes, so named because they lack easily visible granules, are the lymphocytes and monocytes. The ratio of the different types of leukocytes is often a valuable clue in arriving at a diagnosis (see Figure 9-1).',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 253  The most important function of the leukocytes is to destroy pathogens. Whenever pathogens enter the tissues, as through a wound, certain white blood cells (neutrophils and monocytes) are attracted to that area. They leave the blood vessels and proceed by ameboid or ameba-like motion to the area of infection. There they engulf the invaders by a process called phagocytosis. If the pathogens are extremely strong or numerous, they may destroy the leukocytes. A collection of dead and living leukocytes, forms pus. A collection of pus localized in one area is known as abscess. The Lymphocytes destroy foreign invaders by attacking the cells directly or by producing antibodies that circulate in the blood and help destroy the cells.

The many substances necessary for clotting are normally inactive in the blood stream. A balance is maintained between compounds that promote clotting, known as procoagulants, and those that prevent clotting known as anticoagulants. In addition, there are also chemicals in the circulation that act to dissolve clots. Under normal conditions the substances that prevent clotting prevail. However, when an injury occurs, the procoagulants are activated and a clot is formed. Basically, the clotting process consists of the following essential steps (Figure 9-2): 1. The injured tissues release thromboplastin, a substance that triggers the clotting mechanism. 2.',\n",

The obvious measure to take in such an emergency is to inject blood from another person into the veins of the patient, a procedure called transfusion.

These reactions are determined largely by certain proteins, called antigens, on the surface membrane of the red blood cells. There are many types of these proteins but only two groups are particularly likely to cause a transfusion reaction, the so-called A and B antigens and the Rh factor. Four blood types involving the A and B antigens have been recognized: A, B, AB, and O. these letters indicate the types of antigen present on the red cells, with O indicating that neither A nor B antigen is present. It is these antigens ton the donorâs red fells that react with the antibodies in the patientâs plasma and cause a transfusion reaction.  Blood serum containing antibodies that can agglutinate and destroy red cells that have A antigens on the surface is called anti-A serum; blood serum containing antibodies that can destroy red cells with B antigen on the surface is called anti-B serum.

The Rh factor Rh factor is another red cell antigen that determines the blood group. Those individuals who possess this antigen in their red cell surface are said to be Rh positive. Those who lack this antigen are said to be Rh negative. If Rh positive blood is given to an Rh negative person, he or she may become sensitized to the protein in the Rh positive blood. The sensitized personâs blood cells may then produce antibodies to the âforeignâ Rh antigens and destroy the transfused red cells.  A pregnant woman who is Rh negative may become sensitized by proteins from her Rh positive fetus (this factor having been inherited from the father) if these proteins enter the motherâs circulation before or during childbirth.

The valves of the heart are formed by reinforced folds of this material. 2. The myocardium, the muscle of the heart, is the thickest layer. 3.

The two sides are completely separated from each other by a partition called the septum. The upper part of this partition is called interartrial septum; while the larger the lower portion is called interventricular septum.

The right atrium is a thin-walled chamber that receives the blood retuning from the body tissues. This blood, which is low in oxygen, is carried in the veins, the blood vessels leading to the heart from the body tissues.',\n",

The left atrium receives blood high in oxygen content as it returns from the lungs. 4. The left ventricle, which has the thickest walls of all, pumps, oxygenated blood to all parts of the body. This blood goes through the arteries, the vessels that take blood from the heart to the tissues.  Four Valves Since the ventricles are the pumping chambers, the valves, which are all one way, are located at the entrance and the exit of each ventricle. The entrances valves are the atrioventricular valves, while the exit valves are the semilunar valves. Semilunar means âresembling a half moon.â',\n",

When this valve is open, blood flows freely from the right atrium into the right ventricle. However, when the right ventricle begins to contract, the valve closes so that blood cannot return to the right atrium; this ensures forward flow into the pulmonary artery. 2. The left atrioventricular valve is the bicuspid valve, but it is usually referred to as the mirtal valve. It has two rather heavy cusps that permit blood to flow freely from the left',\n",

However, the cusps close when the left ventricle begins to contract; this prevents blood from returning to the left atrium and ensures the forward flow of blood into the aorta. Both the tricuspid and mitral valves are attached by means of thin fibrous threads to the wall of the ventricles. The function of these threads, called the chordae tendineae (see Figure 9-6), is to keep the valve flaps from flipping up into the atria when the ventricles contract and thus causing a backflow of blood. 3. The pulmonic (semilunar) valve is located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery that leads to the lungs. As soon as the right ventricle has finished emptying itself, the valve closes in order to prevent blood on its way to the lungs from returning to the ventricle. 4. The aortic (semilunar) valve is located between the left ventricle and the aorta. Following contraction of the left ventricle, the aortic valve closes to prevent the flow of blood back from the aorta to the ventricle.',\n",

These arteries, which are the first branches of the aorta, arise just above the aortic semilunar valve (see Figure 9-4). They receive blood when the heart relaxes. After passing through capillaries in the myocardium, blood drains into the cardiac veins and finally into the coronary (venous) sinus for return to the right atrium.         Figure 9-4.

Physiology of the Heart  The Work of the Heart Although the right and left side of the heart are separated from each other, they work together. The blood is squeezed through the chambers by a contraction of heart muscle beginning in the thin-walled upper chambers, the atria, followed by a contraction of the thick muscle of the lower chambers, the ventricles. This',\n",

The contraction of the walls of the atria is completed at the time the contraction of the ventricles begins. Thus, the resting phase (diastole) begins in the atria at the same time as the contraction (systole) begins in the ventricles. After the ventricles have emptied, both chambers are relaxed for a short period of time as they fill with blood. Then another beat begins with contraction of the ventricles. This sequence of heart relaxation and contraction is called the cardiac cycle. Each cycle takes an average of 0.8 seconds.  Cardiac muscle tissue has several unique properties. One of these is the interconnection of the muscle fibers. The fibers are interwoven so the stimulation that causes the contraction of one fiber results in the contraction of the whole group.',\n",

When the heart chamber is filled and the wall stretched (within limits), the contraction is strong. As less blood enters the heart, the contraction becomes weaker. As more blood enters the heart, as occurs during exercise, the muscle contracts, with greater strength so push the larger volume of blood out into the blood vessels.

The Conduction System of the Heart The cardiac cycle is regulated by specialized areas in the heart wall that forms the conduction system of the heart. Two of these areas are tissue mass called nodes; the third is a group of fibers called the atrioventricular bundle. The sinoatrial node, which is located I the upper wall of the right atrium an initiates the heart beat, is called the pacemaker. The second node, located in the ineratrial septum at the bottom of the right atrium, is called the atrioventricular node. The atrioventricular bundle, also known as the bundle of His, is located at the top of the interventricular septum; it has branches that extend to all parts of the ventricle walls. Fibers travel first down both sides of the interventricular septum in groups called the right and left bundle branches. Smaller Purkinje fibers then travel in a branching network throughout the myocardium of the ventricles (Figure 9- 6). The order in which the impulses travel is as follows: 1.',\n",

The entire musculature of the ventricles contracts practically at once.

These influences allow the heart to meet changing need rapidly. The heart rate is also affected by such factors as hormones, ions, and drugs in the blood.  Heart Rates 1. Bradycardia is a relatively slow heart rate of less than 60 beats/minute. During rest and sleep, the heart may beat less than 60 beats/minute but usually does not fall below 50 beats/minute. 2.

It occurs at the beginning of ventricular relaxation and is due in large part to sudden closure of the semilunar valves. Some abnormal sounds called murmurs are usually due to faulty action of the valves. For example, if the valves fail to close tightly and blood leaks back, a murmur is heard. Another condition giving rise to an abnormal sound is the narrowing (stenosis) of a valve opening.

The unpaired vessels are large arteries that supply the abdominal viscera. The most important of these visceral branches are listed below: 1. The celiac trunk is a short artery about 1.25 cm long that subdivides into three branches: the left gastric artery goes to the stomach, the splenic artery goes to the spleen, and the hepatic artery carries oxygenated blood to the liver. 2. The superior mesenteric artery, the largest of these branches, carries blood to most of the small intestine as well as to the first half of the large intestine. 3.

The subdivisions include the tibial arteries and dorsalis pedis, which supply the leg and the foot.  Other Subdivisions of Systemic Arteries  Just as the larger branches of a tree give off limbs of varying sizes, so the arterial tree has a multitude of subdivisions. Hundreds of names might be included, but we shall mention only a few. For example, each common carotid artery gives off branches to the thyroid gland and other structures in the neck before dividing into the external and internal carotid artery, which supplies parts of the head.

This arterial circle lies just under the center of the brain and sends branches to the cerebrum and other parts of the brain. 2.

Those at the elbow are often used for removing blood samples for test purposes, as well as for intravenous injections. The largest of this group of veins are the cephalic, the basilic, and the median cubital veins. 2. The saphenous veins of the lower extremities, which are the longest veins of the body.

It is formed by the union of the right and left brachiocephalic veins, which drain the head, neck, and upper extremities. The azygos vein drains the veins of the chest wall and empties into the superior vena cava just before the latter empties into the heart (Figure 9-10).  Inferior Vena Cava  The inferior vena cava, which is much longer than the superior vena cava, returns the blood from the parts of the body below the diaphragm. It begins in the lower abdomen with the union of the two common iliac veins.

They include the iliac veins from near the groin, four pairs of lumbar veins from the dorsal part of the trunk and from the spinal cord, the testicular veins from the testes of the male and the ovarian veins fro m the ovaries of the female, the renal and suprarenal veins from the kidneys and adrenal glands near the kidneys, and finally the large hepatic veins from the liver. For the most part, these vessels empty directly into the inferior vena cava. The left testicular in the male and the left ovarian in the female empty into the left renal vein, which then take this blood to the inferior venal cava; these veins thus constitute exceptions to the rule that the paired veins empty directly into vena cava.  2. Unpaired veins that come from the spleen and from parts of the digestive tract (stomach and intestine) and empty into a vein called the portal vein.

Pulmonary circulation: carry blood to and from the lungs. They in include the pulmonary artery and its branches to the capillaries in the lungs, as well as the veins that drain those capillaries. The pulmonary arteries carry blood low in oxygen from the right ventricle, while the pulmonary veins carry blood high in oxygen from the lungs into the left atrium. This circuit functions to eliminate carbon dioxide from the blood and replenish its supply of oxygen.  2. Systemic circulation: it is the largest circulatory route. It takes oxygenated blood from the left ventricle through the aorta to all parts of the body, including some lung tissue (not air sac or alveolus) and returns the deoxygenated blood to the right atrium, through the systemic veins; the superior vena cava, the inferior vena cava, and the coronary sinus.

Other tributaries of the portal circulation are the gastric, pancreatic, and inferior mesenteric veins.  Upon entering the liver, the portal vein divides and subdivides into ever smaller branches. Eventually, the portal blood flows into a vast network of sinuslike vessels called sinusoids. These are enlarged capillaries that serve as blood channels within the',\n",

After leaving the sinusoids, blood is finally collected by the hepatic veins, which empty into the inferior vena cava (Figure 9- 11).  The purpose of the portal system of veins is to the liver sinusoids so the liver cells can carry out their functions. For example, when food is digested, most of the end products are absorbed from the small intestine into the blood stream and transported to the liver by the portal system. In the liver, these nutrients are processed, stored, and released as needed into the general circulation.  Pulse and Blood Pressure Pulse The ventricles pump blood into the arteries regularly about 70 to 80 times a minute. The force of the ventricular contraction starts a wave of increased pressure that begins at the heart and travels along the arteries. This wave, called the pulse, can be felt in any artery that is relatively close to the surface, particularly if the vessel can be pressed down against a bone. At the wrist the radial artery passes over the bone on the thumb side of the forearm, and the pulse is most commonly obtained here. Other vessels sometimes used for obtaining the pulse are the carotid artery in the neck and the dorsalis pedis on the top of the foot.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 288  Normally, the pulse rate is the same as the heart rate. Only if a heart beat is abnormally weak , or if the artery is obstructed, may the beat not be detected as a pule. In checking the pulse of another person, it is important to use your second or third finger. If you use your thumb, you may find that you are getting your own pulse. When taking a pulse, it is important to gauge the strength as well as the regularity and the rate. Various factors may influence the pulse rate, we will enumerate just a few: 1. The pulse is some what faster in small persons than in large persons usually slightly faster in women than in men. 2. In a new born infant the rate may be from 120 to 140 beats/minute. As the child grows, the rate tends to become slower.',\n",
       " '3. Muscular activity influences the pulse rate. During sleep the pulse may slow down to 60 a minute, while during strenuous exercise the rate may go up to well over 100 a minute. In a person in good condition, the pulse does not remain rapid despite continued exercise. 4. Emotional disturbances may increase the pulse rate. 5. In many infections, the pulse rate increases with the increase in temperature. 6. An excessive amount of secretion from the thyroid gland may cause a rapid pulse.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 289  Blood Pressure  Since the pressure inside the blood vessels varies with the condition of the heart, the blood, and the vessels, as well as with other factors, the measurement and careful interpretation of blood pressure may prove a valuable guide in the care and evaluation of a personâs health. Because blood pressure decreases as the blood flows from arteries into capillaries and finally into veins, measurements ordinarily are mde of arterial pressure only. The instrument used is called a sphygmomanometer, and two variables are measured: 1. Systolic pressure, which occurs during heart muscle contraction, averages around 120 and is expressed in millimetres of mercury (mm Hg). 2. Diastolic pressure, which occurs during relaxation of the heart muscle, averages around 80 mm Hg.  The Lymphatic System The lymphatic system communicates with the blood circulatory system and is closely associated with it. It consists of: 1.

The fundamental purpose of the respiratory system is to supply oxygen to the individual tissue cells and to remove their gaseous waste product, carbon dioxide. Breathing, or ventilation, refers to the inhalation and exhalation of air. Air is a mixture of oxygen, nitrogen, carbondioxide and other gases; the pressure of these gases varies, depending on the elevation above sea level. The first, called external expiration, takes place only in the lungs, where oxygen from the outside air enters the blood and carbondioxide leaves the blood to be breathed into the outside air (Figure 10-1). In the second, called internal respiration, gas exchanges take place between the blood and the body cells, with oxygen leaving the blood and entering the cells at the same time that carbon dioxide leaves the cells and enters the blood.  The respiratory system is an intricate arrangement of spaces and passageways that conduct air into the lungs. These spaces include the nasal cavities; the pharynx, which is common to the digestive and respiratory systems; the voice box, or larynx; the windpipe, or trachea; and the lungs themselves, with their conducting tubes and air sacs. The entire system might be thought of as a pathway for air between the atmosphere and the blood (Figure 10-2).',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 295  Structure and Function of Respiratory Pathways  The Nasal Cavities Air makes its initial entrance into the body through the openings in the nose called the nostrils. Immediately inside the nostrils, located between the roof of the mouth and the cranium, are the two spaces known as the nasal cavities. These two spaces are separated from each other by a partition, the nasal septum. The septum and the walls of the nasal cavities are constructed of bone covered with mucous membrane. From the lateral (side) walls of each nasal cavity are three projections called the conchae. The conchae greatly increase the surface over winch air must travel on its way through the nasal cavities.  The lining of the nasal cavities is a mucous membrane, which contains many blood vessels that bring heat and moisture to it. The cells of this membrane secrete a large amount of fluid. It is better to breath through the nose than through the mouth because of changes produced in the air as it comes in contact with the lining of the nose: 1. Foreign bodies, such as dust particles and pathogens, are filtered out by the hairs of the nostrils or caught in the surface mucus.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 296  The sinuses are small cavities lined with mucous membrane in the bones of the skull. The sinuses communicate with the nasal cavities, and they are highly susceptible to infection.              Figure 10-1.

The Larynx The larynx (voice box) is located between the pharynx and the trachea. It has a framework of cartilage that protrudes in the front of the neck and some times is referred to as the Adamâs apple. The larynx is considerably larger in the male than in the female; hence, the Adamâs apple is much more prominent in the male. At the upper end of the larynx are the vocal cords, which serve in the production of speech. They are set into vibration by the flow of air from the lungs. A difference in the size of the larynx is what accounts for the difference between the male and female voices; because a manâs larynx is larger than a womanâs, his voice is lower in pitch. The nasal cavities, the sinuses, and the pharynx all serve as resonating chambers for speech, just as the cabinet does for a stereo speaker.  The space between these two vocal cords is called the glottis, and the little leaf-shaped cartilage that covers the larynx during swallowing is called the epiglottis.',\n",

You can feel the larynx move upward toward the epiglottis during this process by placing the flat ends of your fingers on your larynx as you swallow.  The larynx is lined with ciliated mucous membrane. The cilia trap dust and other particles, moving them upward to the pharynx to be expelled by coughing, sneezing, or blowing the nose.      The Trachea (Windpipe) The trachea is a tube that extends from the lower edge of the larynx to the upper part of the chest above the heart. It has a framework of cartilages to keep it open. These cartilages, shaped somewhat like a tiny horseshoe or the letter C, are found along the entire length of the trachea. All the open sections of these cartilages are at the back so that the esophagus can bulge into this section during swallowing. The purpose of the trachea is to conduct air between the larynx and the lungs.  The Bronchi and Bronchioles The trachea divides into two bronchi which enter the lungs.',\n",

Because the subdivision of the bronchi resembles the branches of a tree, they have been given the common name bronchial tree.

At the end of each of the smallest subdivisions of the bronchial tree, called terminal bronchioles, is a cluster of air sacs, resembling a bunch of grapes. These sacs are known as alveoli. Each alveolus is a single-cell layer of squamous (flat) epithelium. This very thin wall provides easy passage for the gases entering and leaving the blood as it circulates through millions of tiny capillaries of the alveoli. Certain cells in the alveolar wall produce surfactant, a substance that prevents the alveoli from collapsing by reducing the surface tension (âpullâ) of the fluids that line them. There are millions of alveoli in the human lung. Because of the many air spaces, the lung is light in weight; normally a piece of lung tissue dropped into a glass of water will float.',\n",

       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 302  The Lung Cavities The lungs occupy a considerable portion of the thorax cavity, which is separated from the abdominal cavity by the muscular partition known as the diaphragm. Each lung is enveloped in a double sac of serous membrane called the pleura. The portion of the pleura that is attached to the chest wall is called parietal pleura, while the portion that is reflected onto the surface of the lung is called visceral pleura.  The pleural cavity around the lungs is an air-tight space with a partial vacuum, which causes the pressure in this space to be less than atmospheric pressure. Because the pressure inside the lungs is higher than that in the surrounding pleural cavity, the lungs tend to remain inflated. The entire thoracic cavity is flexible, capable of expanding and contracting along with the lungs. The region between the lungs, the mediastinum, contains the heart, great blood vessels, esophagus, trachea, and lymph nodes.   Physiology of Respiration  Pulmonary Ventilation Ventilation is the movement of air into and out of the lungs, as in breathing. There are two phases of ventilation (Figure10-3): 1. Inhalation is the drawing of air into the lungs.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 303  In inhalation, the active phase of breathing, the respiratory muscles contract to enlarge the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm is a strong dome-shaped muscle attached around the base of the rib cage. The contraction and relaxation of the diaphragm cause a piston-like downward motion that result in an increase in the vertical dimension of the chest. The rib cage is also moved upward and outward by contraction of the external intercostals muscles and, during exertion, by contraction of other muscles of the neck and chest. During quiet breathing, the movement of the diaphragm accounts for most of the increase in thoracic volume.             Figure 10-3. (A) Inhalation. (B) Exhalation (Source: Carola, R., Harley,J.

When the pressure drops to slightly below atmospheric pressure, air is drawn into the lungs.  In exhalation, the passive phase of breathing, the muscles of respiration relax, allowing the ribs and diaphragm to return to their original positions. The tissues of the lung are elastic and recoil during exhalation. During forced exhalation, the internal intercostals muscles and the muscles of the abdominal wall contracts, pulling the bottom of the rib cage in and down. The abdominal viscera are also pushed upward against the diaphragm.  Air Movement   Air enters the respiratory passages and flows through the ever-dividing tubes of the bronchial tree. As the air traverses this passage, it moves more and more slowly through the great number of bronchial tubes until there is virtually no forward flow as it reaches the alveoli. Here the air moves by diffusion, which soon equalizes any differences in the amounts of gases present. Each breath causes relatively little change in the gas composition of the alveoli, but normal continuous breathing ensures the presence of adequate oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide.',\n",

Nerve impulses from the medulla are modified by the centers in the pons. Respiration is regulated so that the levels of oxygen, corbon dioxide, and acid are kept within certain limits. The control centers regulate the rate, depth, and rhythm of respiration.  From the respiratory center in the medulla, motor nerve fibers extend into the spinal cord. From the cervical (neck) part of the cord, these nerve fibers continue through the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm. The diaphragm and the other muscles of respiration are voluntary in the sense that they can be regulated by messages from the higher brain centers, notably the cortex. It is possible for a person to deliberately breath more rapidly or more slowly or to hold his breath and not breath at all for a time.

Food as we take it in, however, is too large to enter the cells. It must first be broken down into particles small enough to pass through the cell membrane. This process is known as digestion. After digestion, food must be carried to the cells in every part of the body by the circulation. The transfer of food into the circulation is called absorption. Digestion and absorption are the two chief functions of the digestive system.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 311  Structure and Function of Organs of Digestion and Accessory Organs  For our purpose the digestive system may be divided into two groups of organs:   1. The digestive tract, a continuous passageway beginning at the mouth, where food is taken in, and terminating at the anus, where the solid waste products of digestion are expelled from the body  2. The accessory organ, which are necessary for the digestive process but are not a direct part of the digestive tract. They release substances into the digestive tract through ducts.  The Walls of the Digestive Tract  Although specified for specific tasks in different organs, the wall of the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the anus, is similar in structure throughout. Follow the diagram of the small intestine in Figure 11-1 as we describe the layers of this wall from the innermost to the outermost surface. First is the mucous membrane, so called because its epithelial layer contains many mucus-secreting cells. The type of epithelium is simple columnar. The layer of connective tissue beneath this, the submucosa, contains blood vessels and some of the nerves that help regulate digestive activity. Next are two layers of smooth muscle.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 312  and the outer layer has longitudinal fibers. The alternate contractions of these muscles create the wavelike movement that propels food through the digestive tract and mixes it with digestive juices. This movement is called peristalsis. The outermost layer of the wall consists of fibrous connective tissue. Most of the abdominal organs have an additional layer of serous membrane that is part of the peritoneum.  The Peritoneum  The abdominal cavity is lined with a thin, shiny serous membrane that also covers most of the abdominal organs (Figure 11-2). The portion of this membrane that lines the abdomen is called the parietal peritoneum; that covering the organ is called the visceral peritoneum. In addition to these single layered portions of the peritoneum there are a number of double-layered structures that carry blood vessels, lymph vessels, and nerves, and sometimes act as ligaments supporting the organs. The mesentery is a double-layered portion of the peritoneum shaped somewhat like a fan. The handle portion is attached to the back wan, and the expanded long edge is attached to the small intestine.',\n",
       " 'Between the two layers of membrane that fOl1ll the mesentery are the blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves that supply the intestine. The section of the peritoneum that extends from the colon to the back wall is the mesocolon.',\n",

This greater omentum extends from the lower border of the stomach into the pelvic part of the abdomen and then loops back up to the transverse colon. There is also a smaller membrane, called the lesser omentum that extends between the stomach and the liver.                  Figure 11-1.

       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 315  The Digestive Tract  The digestive tract, (Figure 11-3), is a muscular tube extending through the body. It is composed of several parts: the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The digestive tract is sometimes called the alimentary tract, derived from a Latin word that means \"food\". It is more commonly referred to as the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract because of the major importance of the stomach and intestine in the process of digestion.                Figure 11-3.

       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 316  The Mouth  The mouth, also called the oral cavity, is where a substance begins its travels through the digestive tract (Figure 11-4). The mouth has three digestive functions:  1. To receive food, a process called ingestion  2. To prepare food for digestion  3. To begin the digestion of starch. In to this space projects a muscular organ, the tongue, which is used for chewing and swallowing, and is one of the principal organs of speech. The tongue has on its surface a number of special organs, called taste buds, by means of which taste sensations (bitter, sweet, sour, or salty) can be differentiated.  The oral cavity also contains the teeth. A child between 2 and 6 years of age has 20 teeth; an adult with a complete set of teeth has 32. Among these, the cutting teeth, or incisors, occupy the front part of the oral cavity, whereas the lager grinding teeth, the molars, are in the back.',\n",

C., (1992), Human anatomy and physiology, Mc Graw hill inc, New York, 2 nd ed,)   Deciduous, or Baby Teeth  The first eight deciduous teeth to appear through the gums are the incisors. Later the canines (eye teeth) and molar appear. Usually, the 20 baby teeth have all appeared by the time a child has reached the age of 2 or 21/2 years. During the first 2 years the permanent teeth develop within the jawbones',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 318  from buds that are present at birth. The first permanent tooth to appear is the important 6-year molar. This permanent tooth comes in before the baby incisors are lost. Because decay and infection of adjacent deciduous molars may spread to and involve new, permanent teeth, deciduous teeth need proper care.  Permanent Teeth  As a child grows, the jawbones grow, making space for additional teeth. After the 6-year molars have appeared, the baby incisors loosen and are replaced by permanent incisors. Next, the baby canines (cuspids) are replaced by permanent canines, and finally, the baby molars are replaced by the bicuspids (premolars) of the permanent teeth.  Now the larger jawbones are ready for the appearance of the 12-year, or second, permanent molar teeth. During or after the late teens, the third molars, or so-called wisdom teeth, may appear. In some cases the jaw is not large enough for these teeth or there are other abnormalities, so that the third molars may have to be removed.',\n",

Saliva also helps keep the teeth and mouth clean and reduce bacterial growth.  This watery mixture contains mucus and an enzyme called salivary amylase, which begins the digestive process by converting starch to sugar. It is manufactured mainly by three pairs of glands that function as accessory organs:',\n",

The submandibular, or sumaxillary, glands are located near the body of the lower jaw  3. The sublingual glands are under the tongue. All these glands empty by means of ducts into the oral cavity.  The Pharynx and Esophagus  The pharynx is commonly referred to as the throat. The oral part of the pharynx is visible when you look into an open mouth and depress the tongue. The palatine tonsils may be seen at either side. The pharynx also extends upward to the nasal cavity and downward to the level of the larynx.',\n",
       " 'The soft palate is tissue that forms the back of the roof of the oral cavity. From it hangs a soft, fleshy, V -shaped mass called the uvula.  In swallowing, a small portion of chewed food mixed with saliva, called a bolus, is pushed by the tongue into the pharynx, swallowing occurs rapidly by an involuntary reflex action. At the same time, the soft palate and uvula are raised to prevent food and liquid from entering the nasal cavity, and the tongue is raised to seal the back of the oral cavity. The entrance of the trachea is guarded during swallowing by a leaf-shaped cartilage, the epiglottis, which covers the opening of the larynx. The swallowed food is then moved by peristalsis',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 321  into esophagus, a muscular tube about 25cm (10 inches) long that carries food into the stomach. No additional digestion occurs in the esophagus.  Before joining the stomach, the esophagus must pass through the diaphragm. It passes through a space in the diaphragm called the esophageal hiatus. If there is a weakness in the diaphragm at this point, a portion of the stomach or other abdominal organ may protrude through the space, a condition called hiatal hernia.  The Stomach  The stomach is an expanded J-shaped organ in the upper left region of the abdominal cavity (Figure 11-6). In addition to the two muscle layers already described, it has a third, inner oblique (angled) layer that aids in grinding food and mixing it with digestive juices. The left-facing arch of the stomach is the greater curvature, whereas the right surface forms the lesser curvature. Each end of the stomach is guarded by a muscular ring, or sphincter, that permits the passage of substances in only one direction.  Between the esophagus and the stomach is the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).',\n",
       " 'This valve has also been called cardiac sphincter because it separates the esophagus from the region of the stomach that is close to the heart. We',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 322  are sometimes aware of the existence of this sphincter; sometimes it does not relax as it should, produce a feeling of being unable to swallow past that point. Between the distal, or far, end of the stomach and the small intestine is the pyloric sphincter. The region of the stomach leading into this sphincter, the pylorus, is important in regulating how rapidly food moves into the small intestine.  The stomach serves as a storage pouch, digestive organ, and churn. When the stomach is empty, the lining forms many folds called rugae. These folds disappear as the stomach expands. (It may be stretched to hold one half of a gallon of food and liquid.)Special cells in the lining of the stomach secrete substances that mix together to form gastric juice, the two main components of which are:  1. Hydrochloric acid (HCL), a s1rong acid that softens the connective tissue in meat and destroys foreign organisms  2. Pepsin, a protein-digesting enzyme.',\n",
       " 'This enzyme is produced in an inactive form and is activated only when food enters the stomach and HCL is produced. The semi-liquid mixture of gastric juice and food that leaves the stomach to enter the small intestine is called chyme.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 323  The Small Intestine  The small intestine is the longest part of the digestive tract. It is known as the small intestine because, although it is longer than the large intestine, it is smaller in diameter, with an average width of about 2.5 cm (1 inch). When relaxed to its full length, the small intestine is about 6 m (20 feet) long. The first 25 cm (10 inches) or so of the small intestine make up the duodenum. Beyond the duodenum are two more divisions: the jejunum, which forms the next two fifths of the small intestine, and the ileum, which constitutes the remaining portion.  The wall of the duodenum contains glands that secrete large amounts or mucus to protect the small intestine from the strongly acid chyme entering from the stomach. Cells of the small intestine also secrete enzymes that digest proteins and carbohydrates. In addition, digestive juices from the liver and pancreas enter the small intestine through a small opening in the duodenum. Most of the digestive process takes place in the small intestine under the effects of these juices.  Most absorption of digested food also occurs through the walls of the small intestine.',\n",
       " 'To increase the surface area of the organ for this purpose, the mucosa is formed into millions of tiny, finger-like projections, called villi (see Figure 11-1), Which give the inner surface a velvety appearance. In',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 324  addition, each epithelial cell has small projecting folds of the cell membrane known as microvilli. These create a remarkable increase in the total surface area available in the small intestine for the absorption of nutrients.  The Large Intestine  Any material that cannot be digested as it passes through the digestive tract must be eliminated from the body. In addition, most of the water secreted into the digestive tract for proper digestion must be reabsorbed into the body to prevent dehydration. The storage and elimination of undigested waste and the reabsorption of water are the functions of the large intestine.  The large intestine is about 6.5 cm (2.5 inches) in diameter and about 1.5 m (5 feet) long. The outer longitudinal muscle fibers form three separate bands on the surface. These bands draw up the wall of the organ to give it its distinctive puckered appearance.  The large intestine begins in the lower right region of the abdomen. The first part is a small pouch called the cecum.',\n",
       " 'Between the ileum of the small intestine and the cecum is a sphincter, the ileocecal valve that prevents food from traveling backward into the small intestine. Attached to the cecum is a small, blind tube containing lymphoid tissue; it is',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 325  called the vernriform appendix (vermiform means \"wotmlike\"). Inflammation of this tissue as a result of infection or obstruction is appendicitis.  The second portion, the ascending colon, extends upward along the right side of the abdomen toward the liver. The large intestine then bends across the abdomen, forming the transverse colon. At this point it bends sharply and extends downward on the left side of the abdomen into the pelvis, forming the descending colon. The lower part of the colon bends posteriorly in an S shape and continues downward as the sigmoid colon. The sigmoid colon empties into the rectum, which serves as a temporary storage area for indigestible or unabsorbable food residue (see Figure 11-3). Enlargement of the veins in this area constitutes haemorrhoids. A narrow portion of the distal large intestine is called the anal canal. This leads to the outside of the body through an opening called the anus.',\n",
       " 'Large quantities of mucus, but no enzymes, are secreted by the large intestine. At intervals, usually after meals, the involuntary muscles within the walls of the large intestine propel solid waste material, called feces or stool, toward the rectum. This material is then eliminated from the body by both voluntary an involuntary muscle actions, a process called defecation.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 326  While the food residue is stored in the large intestine, bacteria that nomla11y live in the colon act on it to produce vitamin K and some of the B-complex vitamins. As mentioned systemic antibiotic therapy may destroy these bacteria and others living In the large intestine, causing undesirable side effects.  The Accessory Structures   The Liver  The liver, often referred to by the word root hepat, is the largest glandular organ of the body (Figure 11-7). It is located in the upper right portion of the abdominal cavity under the dome of the diaphragm. The lower edge of a normal-sized liver is level with the lower margin of the ribs. The human liver is the same reddish brown color as the animal liver seen in the supeln1arket. It has a large right lobe and a smaller left lobe; the right lobe includes two inferior smaller lobes. The liver is supplied with blood through two vessels: the portal vein and the hepatic artery. These vessels deliver about 11/2 quarts of blood to the liver every minute. The hepatic artery carries oxygenated blood, whereas the portal system of veins carries blood that is rich in the end products of digestion.',\n",
       " 'This most remarkable organ has so many functions that only some of its major activities can list here:   1. The storage of glucose (simple sugar) in the form of glycogen, in animal starch. When the blood sugar level',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 327  falls below normal, liver cells convert glycogen to glucose and release it into the bloodstream; this serves to restore the normal concentration of blood sugar. 2. The formation of blood plasma proteins, such as albumin, globulins, and clotting factors  3. The synthesis of urea, a waste product of protein metabolism. Urea is released into the blood and transported to the kidneys for elimination. 4. The modification of fats, so cells all over the body can use them more efficiently  5. The manufacture of bile  6. The destruction of old red blood cells. The pigment released from these cells in both the liver and the spleen is eliminated in the bile.',\n",
       " 'This pigment (bilirubin) gives the stool its characteristic dark color. 7. The detoxification (removal of the poisonous properties) of harmful substances such as alcohol and certain drugs  8. The storage of some vitamins and iron   The main digestive function of the liver is the production of bile. The salts contained in bile act like a detergent to emulsify fat, that is, to break up fat into small droplets that can be acted on more effectively by digestive enzymes. Bile also aids in the absorption of fat from the small intestine. Bile leaves the lobes of the liver by two ducts that merge to foln1 the common hepatic duct. After collecting bile from the gallbladder, this',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 328  duct, now called common bile duct, delivers bile into the duodenum.  The Gallbladder  The gallbladder is a muscular sac on the inferior surface of the liver that serves as a storage pouch for bile. Although the liver may manufacture bile continuously, the body is likely to need it only a few times a day. Consequently, bile from the liver flows into the hepatic ducts and then up through the cystic duct connected with the gallbladder. When chyme enters the duodenum, the gallbladder contracts, squeezing bile through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct leading to the duodenum.  The Pancreas  The pancreas is a long gland that extends from the duodenum to the spleen. The pancreas produces enzymes that digest fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. The protein digesting enzymes are produced in inactive forms, which must be converted to active forms in the small intestine by other enzymes. The pancreas also produces large amounts of alkaline fluid, which neutralizes the chyme in the small intestine, thus protecting the lining of the digestive tract. These juices collect in a main duct that joins the common bile duct or empties into the duodenum near the common bile',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 329  duct. Most persons also have an additional smaller duct that opens into the duodenum.  Because they arte usually confined to proper channels, pancreatic enzymes do not damage body tissues. However, if the bile ducts become blocked, pancreatic enzymes back up into the pancreas. Also, in some cases of gallbladder disease, disease, infection may extend to the pancreas and cause abnormal activation of the pancreatic enzymes. In either circumstance, the pancreas suffers destruction by its own juice, and the outcome can be fatal; this condition is known as acute pancreatitis.  The pancreas also functions as an endocrine gland, producing the hormones insulin and glucagons that regulate sugar metabolism. These secretions of the islets cells are released directly into the blood.  Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates, Fats, and Proteins   Digestion  Digestion, a complex process that occurs in the alimentary canal, consists of physical and chemical changes that prepare food for absorption. Mechanical digestion breaks food into tiny particles, mixes them with digestive juices, moves them',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 330  along the alimentary canal, and finally eliminates the digestive wastes from the body. Chewing or mastication, swallowing or deglutition, peristalsis, and defecation are the main processes of mechanical digestion. Chemical digestion breaks down large, nonabsorbable food moleculesâmolecules that are able to pass through the intestinal mucosa into blood and lymph. Chemical digestion consists of numerous chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes in saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic juice, and intestinal juice.  Carbohydrate Digestion  Very little digestion of carbohydrates (starches and sugars) occurs before food reaches the small intestine. Salivary amylase usually has little time to do its work because so many of us swallow our food so fast. Gastric juice contains no carbohydrate-digesting enzymes. But after the food reaches the small intestine, pancreatic and intestinal juice enzymes digest the starches and sugars. A pancreatic enzyme (amylase) starts the process by changing starches into a double sugar, namely, maltose. Three intestinal enzymesârnaltase, sucrase, and lactaseâdigest double sugars by changing them into simple sugars, chiefly glucose (dextrose).',\n",
       " 'Maltase digests maltose (malt sugar), sucrase digests sucrose (ordinary cane sugar), and lactase digests lactose (milk sugar). The end product of carbohydrate',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 331  digestion is the so-called simple sugar; the most abundant is glucose.  Protein Digestion  Protein digestion starts in the stomach. Two enzymes (renin and pepsin) in the gastric juice cause the giant protein molecules to break up into somewhat simpler compounds. Pepsinogen, a component of gastric juice, is converted into active pepsin enzyme by hydrochloric acid (also in gastric juice). In the intestine, other enzymes (trypsin in the pancreatic juice and peptidases in the intestinal juice) finish the job of protein digestion. Every protein molecule is made up of many amino acids joined together. When enzymes have split up the large protein molecule into its separate amino acids, protein digestion is completed. Hence the end product of protein digestion is amino acids. For obvious reasons, the amino acids are also referred to as protein building blocks.  Fat Digestion  Very little carbohydrate and fat digestion occurs before food reaches the small intestine.',\n",
       " 'Most fats are undigested until after emulsification by bile in the duodenum (that is, fat droplets are broken into very small droplets). After this takes place, pancreatic lipase splits up the fat molecules into fatty acids and glycerol (glycerine). The end products of fat digestion, then, are fatty acids and glycerol.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 332  Table 11-1 summarizes the main facts about chemical digestion. Enzyme names indicate the type of food digested by the enzyme. For example, the name amylase indicates that the enzyme digests carbohydrates (starches and sugars), protease indicates a protein- digesting enzyme, and lipase means a fat-digesting enzyme. When carbohydrate digestion has been completed, starches (polysaccharides) and double sugars (disaccharides) have been changed mainly to glucose, a simple sugar (monosaccharide). The end products of protein digestion, on the other hand, are amino acids. Fatty acids and glycerol are the end products of fat digestion.  Absorption  After food is digested, it is absorbed; that is, it moves through the mucous membrane lining of the small intestine into the blood and lymph. In other words, food absorption is the process by which molecules of amino acids, glucose, fatty acids, and glycerol goes from the inside of the intestines into the circulating fluids of the body. Absorption of foods is just as essential as digestion of foods. The reason is fairly obvious.',\n",
       " 'As long as food stays in the intestines, it cannot nourish the millions of cells that compose all other parts of the body. Their lives depend on the absorption of digested food and its transportation to them by the circulating blood.',\n",
       " 'Human Anatomy and Physiology 333  Structural adaptations of the digestive tube, including folds in the lining mucosa, villi, and micro villi, increase the absorptive surface and the efficiency and speed of transfer of materials from the intestinal lumen to body fluids. Many salts such as sodium are actively transported through the intestinal mucosa. Water follows by osmosis. Other nutrients are also actively transported into the blood of capillaries in the intestinal villi. Fats enter the lymphatic vessels or lacteals found in intestinal villi.
