Chewing or mastication, swallowing or deglutition, peristalsis, and defecation are the main processes of mechanical digestion. Chemical digestion breaks down large, nonabsorbable food molecules−molecules that are able to pass through the intestinal mucosa into blood and lymph. Chemical digestion consists of numerous chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes in saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic juice, and intestinal juice.  Carbohydrate Digestion  Very little digestion of carbohydrates (starches and sugars) occurs before food reaches the small intestine. Salivary amylase usually has little time to do its work because so many of us swallow our food so fast. Gastric juice contains no carbohydrate-digesting enzymes. But after the food reaches the small intestine, pancreatic and intestinal juice enzymes digest the starches and sugars.

Absorption  After food is digested, it is absorbed; that is, it moves through the mucous membrane lining of the small intestine into the blood and lymph.

Chewing or mastication, swallowing or deglutition, peristalsis, and defecation are the main processes of mechanical digestion. Chemical digestion breaks down large, nonabsorbable food molecules−molecules that are able to pass through the intestinal mucosa into blood and lymph. Chemical digestion consists of numerous chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes in saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic juice, and intestinal juice.  Carbohydrate Digestion  Very little digestion of carbohydrates (starches and sugars) occurs before food reaches the small intestine. Salivary amylase usually has little time to do its work because so many of us swallow our food so fast. Gastric juice contains no carbohydrate-digesting enzymes. But after the food reaches the small intestine, pancreatic and intestinal juice enzymes digest the starches and sugars. A pancreatic enzyme (amylase) starts the process by changing starches into a double sugar, namely, maltose. Three intestinal enzymes−rnaltase, sucrase, and lactase−digest double sugars by changing them into simple sugars, chiefly glucose (dextrose).\n",
      "- Human Anatomy and Physiology 331  digestion is the so-called simple sugar; the most abundant is glucose.  Protein Digestion  Protein digestion starts in the stomach. Two enzymes (renin and pepsin) in the gastric juice cause the giant protein molecules to break up into somewhat simpler compounds. Pepsinogen, a component of gastric juice, is converted into active pepsin enzyme by hydrochloric acid (also in gastric juice). In the intestine, other enzymes (trypsin in the pancreatic juice and peptidases in the intestinal juice) finish the job of protein digestion. Every protein molecule is made up of many amino acids joined together. When enzymes have split up the large protein molecule into its separate amino acids, protein digestion is completed. Hence the end product of protein digestion is amino acids. For obvious reasons, the amino acids are also referred to as protein building blocks.  Fat Digestion  Very little carbohydrate and fat digestion occurs before food reaches the small intestine.\n",
      "- Human Anatomy and Physiology 332  Table 11-1 summarizes the main facts about chemical digestion. Enzyme names indicate the type of food digested by the enzyme. For example, the name amylase indicates that the enzyme digests carbohydrates (starches and sugars), protease indicates a protein- digesting enzyme, and lipase means a fat-digesting enzyme. When carbohydrate digestion has been completed, starches (polysaccharides) and double sugars (disaccharides) have been changed mainly to glucose, a simple sugar (monosaccharide). The end products of protein digestion, on the other hand, are amino acids. Fatty acids and glycerol are the end products of fat digestion.  Absorption  After food is digested, it is absorbed; that is, it moves through the mucous membrane lining of the small intestine into the blood and lymph. In other words, food absorption is the process by which molecules of amino acids, glucose, fatty acids, and glycerol goes from the inside of the intestines into the circulating fluids of the body. Absorption of foods is just as essential as digestion of foods. The reason is fairly obvious.\n",
      "- This enzyme is produced in an inactive form and is activated only when food enters the stomach and HCL is produced. The semi-liquid mixture of gastric juice and food that leaves the stomach to enter the small intestine is called chyme.\n",
      "- Human Anatomy and Physiology 329  duct. Most persons also have an additional smaller duct that opens into the duodenum.  Because they arte usually confined to proper channels, pancreatic enzymes do not damage body tissues. However, if the bile ducts become blocked, pancreatic enzymes back up into the pancreas. Also, in some cases of gallbladder disease, disease, infection may extend to the pancreas and cause abnormal activation of the pancreatic enzymes. In either circumstance, the pancreas suffers destruction by its own juice, and the outcome can be fatal; this condition is known as acute pancreatitis.  The pancreas also functions as an endocrine gland, producing the hormones insulin and glucagons that regulate sugar metabolism. These secretions of the islets cells are released directly into the blood.  Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates, Fats, and Proteins   Digestion  Digestion, a complex process that occurs in the alimentary canal, consists of physical and chemical changes that prepare food for absorption. Mechanical digestion breaks food into tiny particles, mixes them with digestive juices, moves them\n",

The mouth has three digestive functions:  1. To receive food, a process called ingestion  2. To prepare food for digestion  3. To begin the digestion of starch. In to this space projects a muscular organ, the tongue, which is used for chewing and swallowing, and is one of the principal organs of speech. The tongue has on its surface a number of special organs, called taste buds, by means of which taste sensations (bitter, sweet, sour, or salty) can be differentiated.  The oral cavity also contains the teeth. A child between 2 and 6 years of age has 20 teeth; an adult with a complete set of teeth has 32. Among these, the cutting teeth, or incisors, occupy the front part of the oral cavity, whereas the lager grinding teeth, the molars, are in the back.\\n- Human Anatomy and Physiology 319              Figure 11-5.

Saliva also helps keep the teeth and mouth clean and reduce bacterial growth.  This watery mixture contains mucus and an enzyme called salivary amylase, which begins the digestive process by converting starch to sugar. It is manufactured mainly by three pairs of glands that function as accessory organs:\\n- The soft palate is tissue that forms the back of the roof of the oral cavity. From it hangs a soft, fleshy, V -shaped mass called the uvula.  In swallowing, a small portion of chewed food mixed with saliva, called a bolus, is pushed by the tongue into the pharynx, swallowing occurs rapidly by an involuntary reflex action. At the same time, the soft palate and uvula are raised to prevent food and liquid from entering the nasal cavity, and the tongue is raised to seal the back of the oral cavity. The entrance of the trachea is guarded during swallowing by a leaf-shaped cartilage, the epiglottis, which covers the opening of the larynx. The swallowed food is then moved by peristalsis\\n- Human Anatomy and Physiology 296  The sinuses are small cavities lined with mucous membrane in the bones of the skull.
