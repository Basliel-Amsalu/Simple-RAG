During fetal life, tests are formed just below the kidneys inside the abdomino-pelvic cavity. By third fetal month it stats is to descend and by the seventh month of fetal life it passes through the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is a passageway leading to scrotum.  Scrotum is a paunch of skin that hangs between the thighs. The tests complete their descent in to the scrotum shortly before or after birth. Because the tests hang in scrotum out side the body their temperature is of cooler than the body temperature by 3 Degree Fahrenheit. This lower temperature is needed for sperm production and survival. Under the skin of scrotum, Cremaster muscle elevates tests during cold weather.',\n",
